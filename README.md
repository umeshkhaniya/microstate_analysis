# microstate_lysozyme_analysis
This is the tutorial for microstate analysis in the Monte Carlo Sampling. During the MCCE run,  millions of microstate are generated and goal here is to analyse  microstates and find out the right protonation state for Molecular Dynamics simulation. In this tutorial, small system 4lzt at pH7 is taken for analysis of mirostate.
