# Microstate Analysis of Protein
This is the tutorial for microstate analysis in the Monte Carlo Sampling. Main idea of this tool is novel way of understanding the charge states of protein molecules. During the MCCE pdb run,  millions of microstate are generated and goal here is to analyse microstates and find out the right protonation state for Molecular Dynamics simulation. In this tutorial, small system 4lzt at pH = 7 is taken for the demo purpose.
